# patPRO
Visualizing Temporal Microbiome Data

## About This Package
patPRO (Patient Profiler)

This is an R package developed for easy visualization of longitudinal microbiome data. This package allows you to process and visualize taxonomic relative and estimated absolute abundance, diversity, and bacterial load. These plots can be merged together to create longitudinal microbiome profiles. The example we use describes profiles of patient microbiomes over time (patient profiles). It works well with default Qiime output, but can also be used easily with Mothur.

## Installation
You can easily download the [package from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patPRO/). If you want the most up-to-date version included here on GitHub, just download the GitHub release and load it into R.
